# **Thai ToDo List App**

A full-stack To-Do list application developed as my first project after my long travel in Thailand. This app allows users to manage tasks with authentication and task assignment features.

## ðŸŒŸ **Features**
- **User Authentication**: 
  - Registration and login with token-based authentication.
- **Task Management**: 
  - Add, delete, and edit tasks (only the author of the task can modify it).
- **Task Assignment**: 
  - Assign tasks to other registered users (only the task author can assign).
  
**Note**: Unfortunately, I didn't deploy this project because I wasn't fully satisfied with the code. However, I plan to revisit and improve it in the future.

## ðŸš€ **Live Demo**
The project is not deployed currently. However, you can explore the source code and future updates on my GitHub.

## ðŸ›  **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

*This is my first full-stack project developed to practice and enhance my skills in frontend and backend development.*
